###HAB TRACKER PROTOTYPE###

Should be compatibile with a LoRa radio in place of the rfm22b. 
Basic board bringup works, running chibios and comms with the ublox gps. 
Next is to work on the radio, and interface to the SPI flash chip for datlogging

Unsure if I want to continue using an RTOS or if it is more trouble than it is worth for a semi-basic high altitude ballooning application. 

Board was designed and first sent to fab in early 2015.
